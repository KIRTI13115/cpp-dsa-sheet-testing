## üõ†Ô∏è How to Contribute

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! Follow the steps below to make your contribution smoothly and effectively:

### ‚≠ê 1. Star and Fork the Repository

- **Star** this repository to show your support!  
- Click on the **Fork** button at the top-right corner of the repository page. This will create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

---

### üêõ 2. Create or Claim an Issue

- Go to the **Issues** tab and check if the task/feature/bug you want to work on already exists.
- If not, click on **"New Issue"** and clearly describe your suggestion or bug.
- Wait for a maintainer to **assign you the issue** before starting work. This avoids duplication and ensures smoother coordination.

### üì• 3. Clone Your Fork

Clone the forked repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/user-name/cpp-dsa-sheet-testing.git
cd cpp-dsa-sheet-testing

### üå± 4. Create a New Branch

Create a dedicated branch for your work:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-branch-name


### ‚ú® 5. Make Your Changes (Next.js Project)

Since this project uses Next.js, there are no separate frontend or backend folders. Follow these updated guidelines:

---

### üß© General Code Guidelines

- Structure your changes within the existing Next.js file system (e.g., `app`, `components`, `utils`, `db`, etc.).
- Follow code styling rules using tools like **ESLint** and **Prettier** (if configured).
- Keep UI **responsive** and **accessible** where applicable.
- For logic or data fetching, ensure proper usage of Next.js **server/client components**.

---

### üóÑÔ∏è Database-Related Contributions

- Database connection logic resides in the `db` folder.
- The database name and constants are managed inside the `constants` folder.

When modifying DB logic, make sure to:

- Maintain consistency with the existing code structure.
- Update or add appropriate types.
- Test all database-related changes **locally**.



### ‚úÖ 6. Stage and Commit Your Changes

Check the status of your changes:

```bash
git status
````

Add all changes:

```bash
git add .
```

Commit with a clear and descriptive message:

```bash
git commit -m "Add: Binary search implementation in utils"
```



### üöÄ 7. Push Your Changes

### 13. Keep Your Branch Updated
If you continue to work on the same branch, keep it updated with the main branch to avoid merge conflicts:
```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
git checkout feature/your-branch-name
git rebase main
```

### 14. Finalize Your Contribution
Once your PR is approved and merged:
