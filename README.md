# DSAMate Template – GSSoC '25

🚀 This repository is a **template version** of [DSAMate](https://dsamate.vercel.app) — your all-in-one platform for practicing DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) questions.  
This version is open for contributions as a part of **GirlScript Summer of Code (GSSoC) 2025**.

> 🚧 **Disclaimer:** This repository is a **template clone** created for open-source learning under GSSoC '25.  
> It uses only placeholder content and UI logic — **no real DSA questions are included**.  
> The **real DSAMate site** with full question lists is live at [dsamate.vercel.app](https://dsamate.vercel.app).
